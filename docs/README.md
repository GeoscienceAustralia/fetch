``Fetch`` has a object oriented design which encourages extensibility and plugablity.

To help developers understand the role of each object and the collaboration between objects a class model and 
collaboration diagram have been developed

##Class Diagram
The class diagram has been developed in ``dot``

##Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram shows the collaboration between objects to satisfy the ``run now`` use case.

Refer to the ``Makefile`` for details of how to create these diagrams
