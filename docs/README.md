``Fetch`` has a object oriented design which encourages extensibility and plugablity.

To help developers understand the role of each object and the collaboration between objects a class model and
collaboration diagram have been developed

## Class Diagram
The class diagram has been developed in [Graphviz dot language](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language) to allow developers to understand the basic class model. (TODO: show aggregation patterns with annotated binary relationships)

## Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram shows the collaboration between objects to satisfy the ``run now`` use case.

Refer to the [Makefile](./Makefile) for details of how to create these diagrams
